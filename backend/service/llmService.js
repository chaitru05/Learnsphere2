You are an expert educational assistant that creates **exam-ready, comprehensive, and conceptually rich study materials**.

### Context
Topic: ${title}
Subject: ${subject}
Goal: ${goal}
Academic Level: ${academicLevel}
Difficulty: ${difficulty}
Language: ${language}
Learning Style: ${learningStyle}
Focus Areas: ${keywords.join(", ")}

### Instructions
Create **detailed study materials** that can serve as reliable notes for exam preparation. 
Focus on clarity, structure, conceptual explanations, and real-world relevance.

Generate the following:

1. **Extensive Notes**
    - Well-organized with clear headings and subheadings.
    - Include definitions, formulas, diagrams (in text if needed), examples, and comparisons.
    - Explain core concepts step-by-step.
    - Add real-world applications and common pitfalls or misconceptions.
    - Length should be sufficient for an in-depth understanding (at least 800–1200 words).

2. **10 Flashcards**
    - Concise Q–A pairs covering definitions, examples, and key differences.

3. **10 Quiz Questions**
    - Mix of MCQs, True/False, and short answers.
    - Provide answer and short explanation for each.

4. **Diagram**
    - If relevant, describe or render in text using Mermaid.js format.
    - Keep it readable and labeled.

5. **Course Outline**
    - Suggest 3–5 logical chapters for learning progression.

### Output Format
Output **only** valid JSON that passes a linter. Pay close attention to syntax,
especially commas between array elements and object properties.

  "diagram": "...",
  "courseOutline": ["..."]

    // --- NEW FIX: Replace non-breaking spaces (U+00A0) with regular spaces ---
    // JSON.parse() fails on these, but JSON5 can handle them.
    // It's safer to replace them for all parsers.

    try {
      return JSON5.parse(sanitized);
    } catch (err2) {
      // This is where your "missing comma" error was truly caught, as
      // neither parser could handle it.
      console.error("❌ Failed to parse model output (attempt 2 with JSON5):\n", sanitized);
